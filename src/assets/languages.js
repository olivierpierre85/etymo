        So, you've invested in language training for your coworkers, but you still feel they don't really use their second language at work.
        <br>
        Or you've been learning a second language for a while, but you never get the chance to speak it at the office - despite having native speakers as colleagues.
      </p>
      <p>
        Sound familiar?
        <br>
        Welcome to Etymo*.
      </p>
      <p>
        My name is Melissa, and I've been a corporate language trainer (EN/NL/FR) since 2017.
        <br>
        In that time, I've found that language learners rarely practice their second language at work if they don't feel empowered to do so - which can be quite an obstacle in multilingual teams.
      </p>
      <p>
        How can you empower your multilingual teams to communicate better?
        <br>
        How can multilingualism become an asset and not an obstacle?
      </p>
      <p>
        Let Etymo* help you find out.
